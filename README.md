# ABSTRACT #
In todayâ€™s digital economy, small-scale local sellers, particularly those creating handmade or unique products, often struggle to reach wider audiences due to the high costs and complexities associated with large e-commerce platforms. To address this issue, the Hyperlocal Marketplace project introduces a platform designed to empower local sellers by offering an accessible and cost-effective way to sell their products online. This platform allows sellers to create accounts, list their stores, and showcase their products without requiring significant technical knowledge or financial investment. Customers, on the other hand, can explore stores and products online, add items to their carts, and complete purchases through a simplified checkout process. Additionally, the system provides sellers with tools to efficiently manage their inventory and track orders, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
The backend of the platform is developed using Django, a robust and secure framework that handles user registration, product management, and order processing, supported by PostgreSQL, a reliable and scalable database management system. PostgreSQL ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data, including user information, product details, and order history. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, delivers a responsive and intuitive interface for both customers and sellers. By prioritizing simplicity and affordability, the platform removes barriers to entry for local artisans, small business owners, and individuals looking to sell handmade or locally sourced products. This approach fosters community-driven commerce by creating an online space where local sellers can directly connect with buyers.
The project has been rigorously tested using sample datasets to ensure seamless functionality and usability. By addressing the specific needs of small-scale sellers, the Hyperlocal Marketplace offers a practical solution for enabling local businesses to thrive in a digital environment. This not only creates opportunities for economic growth but also strengthens community engagement by supporting local commerce in an increasingly digital world.
